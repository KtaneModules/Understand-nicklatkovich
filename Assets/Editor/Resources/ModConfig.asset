  description: "Module generates random ruleset. Each circle on the right represents
    a rule. You have to figure out their meaning through trial and error, then draw
    a line satisfying all rules.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Module is still under development!\r\n*
    Many rules are waiting to be added;\r\n* There is no manual for this module YET.
    So if you want to play this demo you have to figure out how to play this module
    through trial and error;\r\n* Module has no sounds;\r\n* TP support will be added
    when all planned rules are implemented;\r\n* Logging is as simple as possible:
    only a list of rules is displayed."
